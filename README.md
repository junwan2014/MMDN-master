# Training 
1. change the path of training and testing datasets to your own paths in main.py. 
-imgdirs_train = ['D:/dataset/300W/300W_LP/300W/']
-imgdirs_test_commomset = ['D:/dataset/300W/300W_LP/ibug/']

2. python ./main.py

# Testing
1. change the path of training and testing datasets to your own paths in demo.py. 

  imgdirs_test_commomset = ['D:/dataset/ibug/']
